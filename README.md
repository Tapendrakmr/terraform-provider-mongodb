- This terraform providre allows to perform Create ,Read ,Update ,Delete and Import MongoDB user
- To import a user use EmailID

## Requirements

- [Go Lang](https://golang.org/doc/install)>=1.11 <br>
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)>=v0.13.0 <br/>
- MongoDB Basic Account
- [MongoDB API Credentials](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/configure-api-access/)
- [MongoDB API documentation](https://docs.cloudmanager.mongodb.com/reference/api/users/)

## Application Account
This provider can be successfully tested on a basic mongoDB cloud manager account.

## Setup 
1.Create a mongoDB account(https://account.mongodb.com/account/)

## API Authentication

5. Click Create API Key.
6. Enter the API Key Information
7. Click Next and save the Public and Private key.


## Building The Provider
1. Clone the repository, add all the dependencies and create a vendor directory that contains all dependencies. For this, run the following commands:
```bash
go mod init terraform-provider-mongodb
go mod tidy
go mod vendor
```
## Managing terraform plugins

- Clone or Download the repositor. <br>
- Add the Public key,Private key and Organization id generated in API Key
- Run the following command :

```bash
go mod init terraform-provider-mongodb
go mod tidy
```

- Run go mod vendor to create a vendor directory that contains all the provider's dependencies.

## Managing plugins for terraform
1. Run the following command to create a vendor subdirectory which will comprise of all provider dependencies. 
```
%APPDATA%/terraform.d/plugins/${host_name}/${namespace}/${type}/${version}/${target}
```
Command:
```
mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/mongdb.com/edu/mongodb/0.2/[OS_ARCH]
```
For eg. mkdir -p %APPDATA%/.terraform.d/plugins/mongdb.com/edu/mongodb/0.2/windows_amd64

2. Run `go build -o terraform-provider-mongodb.exe`. This will save the binary (`.exe`) file in the main/root directory. <br>
3. Run this command to move this binary file to the appropriate location.

```
move terraform-provider-mongodb.exe %APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins\mongdb.com\edu\mongodb\0.2\[OS_ARCH]
```
[OR]
1. Manually move the file from current directory to destination directory.<br>

## Working with terraform
### Application Credential Integration in terraform
1. Add terraform block and provider block as shown in example usage.  
2. Get credentials :Public Key, Private Key and Organization ID  
3. Assign the above credentials to the respective field in the provider block.` <br>

### Basic Terraform Commands

- `terraform init` -To initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
- `terraform plan` - To create an execution plan. Displays the changes to be done.
- `terraform apply` - To execute the actions proposed in a Terraform plan. Apply the changes.
- `terraform destroy` - Destroy previously-created
  infrastructure

### Invite User

1.  Add the user email and [Organization roles](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/api/user-update/) in the respective field as shown in  example usage
2. Run the basic terraform commands.
3.  You will see that a user has been successfully created and an invitation mail has been sent to the user.

### Update the user

*If you own an organization or project, you can update the user roles for any user with membership in that organization or project. You cannot modify any other user profile information.*

1. Update the data of the user resource block as show in [example usage](#example-usage) un the basic terraform commands to update user.User is not allowed to update email.
<br>

### Read the User Data

1. Add `data` and `output` blocks as shown in the [example usage](#example-usage) and run the basic terraform commands.

### Delete the user


1. Delete the `resource` block of the user and run `terraform apply`.

### Import a User command

1.  Write manually a `resource` configuration block for the user as shown in [example usage](#example-usage). Imported user will be mapped to this block
2. Run the command `terraform import mongodb_user.resource_name [EMAIL_ID]`
3.Run `terraform plan`, if output shows `0 to add, 0 to change and 0 to destroy` user import is successful, otherwise recheck the user data in `resource` block with user data in mongoDB website.

## Example Usage <a id="example-usage"></a>

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    mongodb = {
      source = "Tapendrakmr/mongodb"
      version = "0.2.4"
    }
  }
}

provider "mongodb" {
  mongodb_public_key = "[MONGODBCLOUD_PUBLIC_KEY]"
  mongodb_private_key = "[MONGODBCLOUD_PRIVATE_KEY]"
  mongodb_orgid = "[MONGODBCLOUD_ORGID]"
}

resource "mongodb_user" "user1" {
  username="user@gmail.com"
  roles=["ORG_Role1","ORG_Role2",..]
}

data "mongodb_user" "user" {
  id = "user@gmail.com"
